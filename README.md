# SNOWFALL
[View the live project here.](https://snowfall-c93ef0e44aa3.herokuapp.com/)

Snow Fall is in essence, a game about surving the the brutal cold of a Tundra.
I choose this topic because I have an interest in survival stories.
My goal is to create an interactive and fun game in which
the player will have to make difficult choices in order to win.

## Features
The game will feature many branching pathways, some leading to a game over
and some leading to win scenario. The player will be given situational context 
and presented with options on which direction they would like to go.

        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to have everything displayed clearly and understandably

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find new pathways and hame content I missed on the first run
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to have fun exploring the game and be motivated to try new things
